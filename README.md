# fluxboard-styles

Shared styles and variables for front end and back board Fluxboard apps.

In development you can run `watchman -- trigger $PWD cr '**/*.scss' -- sh cp_to_solarsystem.sh `  or `watchman -- trigger $PWD cr '**/*.scss' -- sh cp_to_mapdwell.sh ` in this repo's directory, to watch for changes and copy files directly into node_modules of other repos.
